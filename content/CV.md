# Work experience and skills
- Name: **UENO, MASAYOSHI**
- Specialization: **Bioinformatics** / **Web Development** / **Medicinal Chemistry**

## PR
I majored in chemistry and biochemistry at university, and then in pharmaceutical science and neuroscience at graduate school. After gaining experience in the education industry, I became interested in programming when the AI boom hit while I was studying at graduate school, and I started to teach myself Python.
I worked as a SES for about six months at a startup in Tokyo, using Python/SPSS for analytical work.
After that, I worked for about a year as the main programmer and environment builder on a project related to the data migration of the accounting system of a mega-venture company that was working on a CtoC app.
After leaving the company, I became a freelancer and my main work is front-end/server-side development of web systems.
My strengths are server-side development in Python & Django/Flask and front-end development in JavaScript/Vue.js, based on my experience to date.
I have been involved in the development of accounting-related applications for about two years, so I have a certain level of knowledge of bookkeeping and accounting.
I also have experience as a project manager (deciding on specifications, coordinating with customers, etc.).
I also have experience in building infrastructure environments using AWS, although this was not a long-term project.
I am also able to handle business correspondence in English.
In recent years, I have been interested in web development related to machine learning and data science, and I would like to make such work the main focus of my career.
In my free time, I am also involved in research as a researcher at a graduate school of pharmacy, researching the discovery of new pharmaceutical molecules using deep learning.
I am working hard every day with the goal of improving my knowledge and practical skills through the synergy of work and research.
